# Theoretical-Models-in-Computing
A place to store codes for HCMIU Theoretical Models in Computing labs

As far as I remember it goes like this:<br>
Lab 1: TMC Lab1, Approx Through Iter Cos(0.3pi), Taylor approx <br>
Lab 2: Bisection and Falsi, Newton-Raphson method<br>
Lab 3: Gauss-Siedel and Jacobi methods<br>
Lab 4: Newton's Algorithm, Steepnest Descent Method<br>
Lab 5: Golden-Section search, Random Search, (Bonus from Ms. Nga): HyperOptimization<br>
Lab 6: Newton's Interpol Poly<br>
Lab 7 and 8: We have not done it.<br>
