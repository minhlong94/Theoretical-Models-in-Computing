# Theoretical Models in Computing (Numerical Methods)
A place to store code for HCMIU Theoretical Models in Computing labs (aka Numerical Methods)

As far as I remember it goes like this:<br>
Lab 1: Errors and Taylor Series <br>
Lab 2: Nonlinear Equations <br>
Lab 3: Linear Equations <br>
Lab 4: Optimization and HyperOpt <br>
lab 5: Regression <br>
